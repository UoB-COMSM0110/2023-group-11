**Project Report**

1. Team

o Who’s in your team + team photo.

2. Introduction (5% ~250 words)

o Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel?

3. Requirements (15% ~750 words)

o Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop?

4. Design (15% ~750 words)

o System architecture. Class diagrams, behavioural diagrams.

5. Implementation (15% ~750 words)

o Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the three areas of challenge in developing your game.

6. Evaluation (15% ~750 words)

o One qualitative evaluation (your choice)

o One quantitative evaluation (of your choice)

o Description of how code was tested.

7. Process (15% ~750 words)

o Teamwork. How did you work together, what tools did you use. Did you have team roles? Reflection on how you worked together.

8. Conclusion (10% ~500 words)

o Reflect on project as a whole. Lessons learned. Reflect on challenges. Future work.

· Quality of report writing, presentation, use of figures and visual material (5%)

· Documentation of code (5%)

· Individual contribution. Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which may be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Let us know as soon as possible if there are any issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent.


Project Presentation

Your team will be presenting the project as a playable demo in the last week of TB2 and in a demo video:

· Games Demo (50%)

o There will be a live games demo in the last week of TB2 (date to be confirmed). This is a chance to show your game off to the rest of the cohort and the department.

o We will play your game (so it must run!). Plan for a short play-through of maximum 5mins. Markers will circulate and play all the games.

o The marking criteria is simple. You will pass if your team has a working and playable game! Higher marks will be given if your game is fun and engaging and

demonstrates challenge (refer to those three challenges). We look forward to playing your game! :-)

· Demo Video (50%)

o Include this at the top of the Project Report (can host it on YouTube / Streams)

o This is a snappy and fun video up to ~3mins long, for a lay audience to understand (just to confirm, we’re not penalising you if you go slightly under or over, but we may stop watching if it goes too far above 3mins!)

o Things to consider including: What’s your novel idea? Who is your team? And what were their roles? What were your three challenges? What does gameplay look like? What was your process? What’s next?

o This video should sell your idea and make people want to play! Think Kickstarter. Would someone want to fund further development after watching this?

o You don’t have to all appear in or narrate the video, we are assuming this is a team effort, so won’t be looking out for everyone to be in it!

o We will be marking this on: Presentation, use of visual material, clarity of idea, discussion of the three challenges, discussion of process and teamwork, discussion of future work.
